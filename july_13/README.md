.Inspiration
  I wanted to do something that would just help me get used to processing.
.Links
  https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/
  https://discourse.processing.org/t/changing-shape-colors-in-loops/14117/2
  Processing reference page was used a lot.
.My difficulties
  My difficulties were just that I'm very new to this program and coding in
  general so I just had to review a lot of the basics but rewatching the zoom 
  recordings and the Processing Reference page really helped.
