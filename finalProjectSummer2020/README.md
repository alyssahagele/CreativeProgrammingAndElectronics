Project Description:
My project is an Ultrasonic Sensor Module that senses when your hand is near and at different lengths, different LED lights are activated
along with different tunes from a buzzer. I was inspired by Golan Levin's art pieces and I wanted to make a more simplistic version of his audio-
visual pieces but I didn't have a sound senor so I made a more mix of all his pieces in a simple way by taking inspiration from his piece "Footfalls" 
which uses proximal detectors like mine and I wanted to use something like his audiosensory pieces so I included the buzzer to play different tunes
because his audio to visual or visual to audio pieces are the ones I admired the most.

Inspiration:
Golan Levin "Footfalls" + mix of other pieces
