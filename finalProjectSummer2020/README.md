Project Description:

My project is an Ultrasonic Sensor Module that senses when your hand is near and at different lengths, different LED lights are activated
along with different tunes from a buzzer. I was inspired by Golan Levin's art pieces and I wanted to make a more simplistic version of his audio-
visual pieces but I didn't have a sound senor so I made a more mix of all his pieces in a simple way by taking inspiration from his piece "Footfalls" 
which uses proximal detectors like mine and I wanted to use something like his audiosensory pieces so I included the buzzer to play different tunes
because his audio to visual or visual to audio pieces are the ones I admired the most.

Problems I Had:

For some reason my arduino wasn't showing up under ports so I wasn't able to upload my program when I wanted to but after waiting 2 hours and trying again
it worked. Then when I uploaded my program, the lights and the ultrasonic sensor module wasn't working either so I adjusted the wiring under the senor module which worked; then I realized that the LED lights had no power which is why those weren't working so I fixed that and everything was working fine. The code was difficult beause I wasn't that experienced with buzzer and the ultrasonic senor module but after researching I figured it out.
