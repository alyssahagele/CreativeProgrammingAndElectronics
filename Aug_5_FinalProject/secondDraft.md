Originally I wanted to do something similar to Golan Levin's pieces which many include detecting sound and outputting something
which I wanted to detect sound and output flashing led lights, but after realizing I either can't find my sound detector or never had one in the first place, I did more research with more of his pieces because I liked his work and in many of his pieces he
uses detectors that detect objects; thus making me realize that I could use the proximity detector to make some sort of creation. I was specifically looking at his "Footfalls" art piece as it uses a proximity detector to detect the person standing in front of the piece. Since I could not make
something that advanced I decided to incorporate the proximity detector with several LED lights. 

My Project:
I'm going to make a program that can detect how far your hand is (the input being the proximity detector) and outputting flashing led lights
and the buzzer makes different sounds as your hand gets closer/farther.

Risks:
Some risks I am taking doing this project is that I have never used a proximity detector before and I've had difficulties with the buzzer in the past,
if I can do everything how I plan to maybe I can expand the project a little bit but the proximity detector and buzzer is going to be a challenge on it's
own.

Materials I need:
Arduino Uno
Breadboard
HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Sensor
Buzzer
2x Green LEDs
2x Yellow LEDs
2x Red LEDs
