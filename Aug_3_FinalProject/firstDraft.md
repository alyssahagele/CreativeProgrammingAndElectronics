Alyssa Hagele- Final Project First Draft
	  For my final project I want to use the sound sensors (as an input), which can sense different frequencies thus different led lights (outputs)  
  are activated. For my presentation I did Golan Levin and I thought his audio to visual pieces were very intriguing and his projects like 
  “the Hidden World of Noise and Voice”. This was a piece where the computer could make out short words and the words appeared on the screen 
  and the shapes on the screen were altered by the surrounding sounds. The way my project would work is that the person using it can speak/clap 
  and different led lights will come on according to the different frequency it perceives.
